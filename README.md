![ML_png](https://github.com/DataScience-Project-New-Group-4/Employee-Churn/assets/136507704/937e30b9-d38f-49dd-b89e-8e8a05b35b59)

**Introduction**

The movement of workforce in and out of work position within an organization refers to employee churn. The more workforce leaves as a result of attrition (movement out of a work position without replacement) or turnover (movement out of a position and new hire into the position) affects the business or organization negatively except in the situation of “Hiring Freeze”, a situation where the business or company want to lower cost and therefore would leave a vacant position unfilled for a specific period of time, absorbed into other roles or even eliminated totally.

**Problem Statement**

Employee churn leads to reduction in the head count of workforce, it increases cost of new hire (recruitment, hiring, training and Onboarding), leads to disruption in business activities, increase burden on skilled, experienced and existing workforce among many others. 
However, understanding and managing employee churn rate positively impacts business and workforce performance, growth and productivity as this would increase employee retention and ensure business continuity. 
For this project we would:
1.	Ascertain Key indicators of an employee leaving the organization.
2.	Predict why and when employees can most likely leave the organization. 
3.	Recommend strategies to implore to ensure or improve employee retention
